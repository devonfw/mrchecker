== Overview

*Cucumber / Selenium*

Business and IT don’t always understand each other. Very often misunderstandings between business and IT result in the costly failure of IT projects. With this in mind, Cucumber was developed as a tool to support human collaboration between business and IT.

Cucumber uses executable specifications to encourage a close collaboration. This helps teams to keep the business goal in mind at all times. With Cucumber you can merge specification and test documentation into one cohesive whole, allowing your team to maintain one single source of truth. Because these executable specifications are automatically tested by Cucumber, your single source of truth is always up-to-date.

Cucumber supports testers when designing test cases. To automate these test cases, several languages can be used. Cucumber also works well with Browser Automation tools such as Selenium Webdriver.

==== Selenium

Selenium automates browsers and is used for automating web applications for testing purposes. Selenium offers testers and developers full access to the properties of objects and the underlying tests, via a scripting environment and integrated debugging options.

Selenium consists of many parts. If you want to create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests, Selenium Webdriver is most appropriate. With Selenium Webdriver you can also scale and distribute scripts across many environments.

=== Strengths

==== Supports BDD

Those familiar with Behavior Driven Development (BDD) recognize Cucumber as an excellent open source tool that supports this practice.

==== All in one place

With Cucumber / Selenium you can automate at the UI level. Automation at the unit or API level can also be implemented using Cucumber. This means all tests, regardless of the level at which they are implemented, can be implemented in one tool.

==== Maintainable test scripts

Many teams seem to prefer UI level automation, despite huge cost of maintaining UI level tests compared to the cost of maintaining API or unit tests. To lessen the maintenance of UI testing, when designing UI level functional tests, you can try describing the test and the automation at three levels: business rule, UI workflow, technical implementation.

When using Cucumber combined with Selenium, you can implement these three levels for better maintenance.

==== Early start

Executable specifications can and should be written before the functionality is implemented. By starting early, teams get most return on investment from their test automation.

==== Supported by a large community

Cucumber and Selenium are both open source tools with a large community, online resources and mailing lists.

== How to run cucumber tests in Mr.Checker

=== Command line / Jenkins

* Run cucumber tests and generate Allure report. Please use this for Jenkins execution. Report is saved under _./target/site_.
+
    mvn clean -P cucumber test site
+
* Run and generate report
+
    mvn clean -P cucumber test site allure:report
+
* Run cucumber tests, generate Allure report and start standalone report server
+
    mvn clean -P cucumber test site allure:serve

=== Eclipse IDE

=== IntelliJ IDE

image::images/cucumber_IntelliJ_IDE.jpg[]

Before running cucumber subproject you have to configure your IDE

1. Mark mrchecker-selenium-cucumber-example/src/test/java as *Test Sources Root*

2. Mark mrchecker-selenium-cucumber-example/src/test/resources as *Test Resources Root*

3. Open *Edit Configurations*

4. Make sure *Run* has the following command
+
    mvn clean -P cucumber test site allure:report
+

5. Edit *Working directory*

6. Select mrchecker-selenium-cucumber-example as *Working directory*

== Cucumber project structure

===Example project structure

image::images/cucumber_project_structure.jpg[]

===Feature Files

*Feature files* are core part of *BDD* approach with *Cucumber*. The idea behind them is to allow communication between everyone, even without technical skill.

*Feature files* are written with *Gherkin*, which syntax is simple, trying to imitate plain english.

This is the place for test scenarios, which are scripted chain of commands that drives the process.

===Step definitions

While *feature files* are simple lines describing actions, they have to be connected to a script that actually does the work.

*Step definition file* is the place to code methods that are called by the appropriate *test step*.

A good practice is to follow *Page Object Pattern* to keep your step definitions clean and expandable, you can find more information https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/page_object_models/#:~:text=Page%20Object%20is%20a%20Design,a%20page%20of%20your%20AUT.[here].

===Test runner

*Test runner* is used to create communication between *Feature files* and *Step definitions*, execute tests and report results.

In test runner annotations you can edit each of mentioned above.

== Tooling

==== Cucumber

Cucumber supports over a dozen different software platforms. Every Cucumber implementation provides the same overall functionality, but they also have their own installation procedure and platform-specific functionality. See https://cucumber.io/docs for all Cucumber implementations and framework implementations.

Also, IDEs such as Intellij offer several plugins for Cucumber support.

==== Selenium

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

=== Automation process

==== Write a feature file

Test automation in Cucumber starts with writing a feature file. A feature normally consists of several (test)scenarios and each scenario consists of several steps.

Feature: Refund item

Scenario: Jeff returns a faulty microwave

Given Jeff has bought a microwave for $100

And he has a receipt

When he returns the microwave

Then Jeff should be refunded $100

Above example shows a feature “Refund item” with one scenario “Jeff returns a faulty microwave”. The scenario consists of four steps each starting with a key word (Given, And, When, Then).

==== Implementing the steps

Next the steps are implemented. Assuming we use Java to implement the steps, the Java code will look something like this.

----
public class MyStepdefs \{

	@Given("Jeff has bought a microwave for $(\d+)")

	public void Jeff_has_bought_a_microwave_for(int amount) \{

		// implementation can be plain java

		// or selenium

		driver.findElement(By.name("test")).sendKeys("This is an example\n");

		driver.findElement(By.name("button")).click();// etc
	}
}
----

Cucumber uses an annotation (highlighted) to match the step from the feature file with the function implementing the step in the Java class. The name of the class and the function can be as the developer sees fit. Selenium code can be used within the function to automate interaction with the browser.

==== Running scenarios

There are several ways to run scenarios with Cucumber, for example the JUnit runner, a command line runner and several third party runners.

==== Reporting test results

Cucumber can report results in several different formats, using formatter plugins

=== Features

==== Feature files using Gherkin

Cucumber executes your feature files. As shown in the example below, feature files in Gherkin are easy to read so they can be shared between IT and business. Data tables can be used to execute a scenario with different inputs.

==== Organizing tests

Feature files are placed in a directory structure and together form a feature tree.

Tags can be used to group features based on all kinds of categories. Cucumber can include or exclude tests with certain tags when running the tests.

=== Reporting test results

Cucumber can report results in several formats, using formatter plugins.
Not supported option by Shared Services: The output from Cucumber can be used to present test results in Jenkins or Hudson depending of the preference of the project.

= What is Page Object Model in Playwright?

When creating test cases with Playwright, it's important to consider maintainability and reducing duplicated code.
The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that addresses these concerns.
Duplicated code can lead to difficulties in maintaining the project, especially if there are changes in locators or functionality.
POM aims to make test code more robust and maintainable by minimizing duplicated code.
Moreover, it enhances readability and facilitates the creation of interactive documentation, ultimately enabling the creation of tests with greater efficiency.
The central idea of the Page Object Model is to separate the abstraction of the test objects from the test scripts.

In the context of Playwright, the Page Object Model involves structuring your test automation code in a way that the interactions with different pages or components are encapsulated within separate Page Objects.
These Page Objects abstract away the details of how the interactions are implemented, providing a clear separation between the test scripts and the underlying implementation details.
This separation enhances code maintainability, as changes to locators or interactions only need to be made within the respective Page Object, rather than across the entire test suite.

== Implementation Steps

1. *Page Objects:* Create separate classes for each page or component you're interacting with.
These classes should encapsulate the locators and interactions relevant to that page or component.

2. *Methods:* Within each Page Object class, define methods that represent various interactions on that page or component.
For instance, if you have a login page, you might have methods like `login(username, password)` and `submitLoginForm()`.

3. *Locators:* Instead of scattering locators (selectors) throughout your test scripts, define them within the corresponding Page Object classes.
This centralizes the locators, making it easier to update them if they change.

4. *Test Scripts:* In your actual test scripts, you'll create instances of the Page Object classes and call the methods to perform interactions.
This keeps your test scripts focused on high-level actions and makes them more readable.

By following the Page Object Model, you can improve the maintainability, readability, and efficiency of your Playwright test automation projects.

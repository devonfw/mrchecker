= Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is a process closely related to CI, which is an automated way to push code changes to selected environments and improve quality during product release.

In this subsection you will learn the basics of CD with MrChecker.

== Overview

CD from Jenkins point of view does not change a lot from Continuous Integration one.

== Jenkins Overview

Use the same Jenkins settings for Jenkins CD setup as for link:DevOPS-Test-Module-Continuous-Integration-CI.asciidoc[CI], please. The only difference is:

* What type of test you will execute. Before, we have been choosing test case(s), now we will choose test suite(s)
* Who will trigger the given Smoke/Integration/Performance job
* What is the name of official branch. This branch ought always to use be used in every CD execution. It will be either *master* or *develop*.

=== Jenkins for Smoke Tests

In the $TESTNAME variable, where we input the test name( https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/continuous-integration#initial-configuration[check initial configuration] ), please input the name of a test suite assembled together of tests tagged as smoke tests - thus running all the smoke tests( link:Core-Test-Module-test-groups-tags.asciidoc[learn more about tags] ).

=== Jenkins for Performance Tests

Under construction - added when WebAPI module is included.

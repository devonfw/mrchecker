== Overview

CD from Jenkins point of view does not change a lot from Continuous Integration one.

== Jenkins Overview

Use the same Jenkins settings for Jenkins CD setup as for CI, please. https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/continuous-integration#jenkins-configuration[link]. The only difference is:

* What type of test you will execute. Before, we have been choosing test case(s), now we will choose test suite(s)
* Who will trigger the given Smoke/Integration/Performance job
* What is the name of official branch. This branch ought always to use be used in every CD execution. It will be either *master* or *develop*.

=== Jenkins for Smoke Tests

In the $TESTNAME variable, where we input the test name( https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/continuous-integration#initial-configuration[link] ), please input the name of a test suite assembled together of tests tagged as smoke tests -( https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/tags-and-test-suites[link] ) thus running all the smoke tests.

=== Jenkins for Performance Tests

Under construction - added when WebAPI module is included.

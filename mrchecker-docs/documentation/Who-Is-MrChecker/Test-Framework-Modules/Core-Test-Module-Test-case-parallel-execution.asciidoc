= What is "Parallel test execution" ?

Parallel test execution means many _"Test Classes"_ can run simultaneously.

_"Test Class"_, as this is a Junit Test class, it can have one or more test cases - _"Test case methods"_

= How many parallel test classes can run simultaneously?

*Since mrchecker-core-module version 5.6.2.1*

JUnit5 supports parallelism natively. The feature is configured using a property file located at `src\test\resources\junit-platform.properties`.
As per default configuration, concurrent test execution is set to run test classes in parallel using the thread count equal to a number of your CPUs.

Visit https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[JUnit5 site] to learn more about parallel test execution.

*Prior to mrchecker-core-module version 5.6.2.1*

By default, number of parallel test classes is set to 8.

It can be updated as you please, on demand, by command line:

    mvn test site -Dtest=TS_Tag1 -Dthread.count=16

_-Dthread.count=16_ - increase number of parallel Test Class execution to 16.

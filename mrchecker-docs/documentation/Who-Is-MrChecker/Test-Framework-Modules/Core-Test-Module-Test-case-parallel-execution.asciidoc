= What is "Parallel test execution" ?

Parallel test execution means many _"Test Classes"_ can run simultaneously.

_"Test Class"_, as this is a Junit Test class, it can have one or more test cases - _"Test case methods"_

= How many parallel test classes can run simultaneously?

JUnit5 supports parallelism natively. The feature is configured using a property file located at `src\test\resources\junit-platform.properties`.
As per default configuration, concurrent test execution is set to run test classes in parallel using the thread count equal to a number of your CPUs.

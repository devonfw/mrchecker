== BFLogger

BFLogger is a default MrChecker logging tool. Use it to communicate important information from test execution. There are three basic logging methods: 

* `logInfo(String message)` - used for test steps 
* `logDebug(String message)` - used for non-official information, either during the test build process or in Page Object files 
* `logError(String message)` - used to emphasize critical information 

Logs will be visible in the console and in the log file under path: MrChecker_Test_Framework\workspace\project-folder\logs

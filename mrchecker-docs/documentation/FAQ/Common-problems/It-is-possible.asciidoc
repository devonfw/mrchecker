= Is it possible to use Docker with MrChecker?

MrChecker works seamlessly with Docker.

A direct example of how to use it can be found in following JenkinsFile https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/blob/develop/mrchecker-app-under-test/pipelines/CI/Jenkinsfile_node.groovy

Note that the structure of the folders can be changed. If that happens - search in repo for  _/pipeline/CI/Jenkinsfile_node.groovy_

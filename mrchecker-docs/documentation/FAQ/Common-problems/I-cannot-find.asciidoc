= I can't find the boilerplate module. Has it been removed?

The _boilerplate_ module has been removed from the GitHub project on purpose.

There were problems with naming and communication, not everybody was aware of the meaning of the word _boilerplate_.

The name of the folder has been changed to _template_. It can be found in the GitHub project.

There are a few ways to define parameters for tests.

= Internal Data driven approach

Data as *part* of *test case*

Parameters that are passed into tests using the `@Parameters` annotation must be _Object[]_'s

The different means to pass in parameters are shown below.

=== In the annotation:

----
@Parameters({"1, 2, 3", "3, 4, 7", "5, 6, 11", "7, 8, 15"})
----

The parameters must be primitive objects such as integers, strings, or booleans. Each set of parameters is contained within a single string and will be parsed to their correct values as defined by the test method’s signature.

=== In a method named in the annotation:

----
@Parameters(method = "addParameters")
----

A separate method can be defined and referred to for parameters. This method must return an `Object[]` and can contain normal objects.

=== In a class:

----
@Parameters(source = MyContainsTestProvider.class)
----

A separate class can be used to define parameters for the test. This test must contain at least one static method that returns an Object[], and its name must be prefixed with provide. The class could also contain multiple methods that provide parameters to the test, as long as they also meet the required criteria.

= External Data Driven

Data as *external file injected* in *test case*

Tests use the annotation @FileParameters to inject CSVs file.

----
@FileParameters("src/test/resources/datadriven/test.csv")
----

A CSV can also be used to contain the parameters for the tests. It is pretty simple to set up, as it’s just a comma separated list.

= Mobile Test Module

== What is MrChecker E2E Mobile Test Module

MrChecker E2E Mobile test Module is a suitable solution for testing Remote Web Design, Mobile Browsers and application.
A user can write tests suitable for all mobile browsers with full range of resolution. The way of working is simmilar ro Selenium and uses the same rules and pattarns as the Web Driver. For more information please look in the Selenium test module. 

== What is Page Object Architecture

Creating Selenium test cases can result in an unmaintainable project. One of the reasons is that too many duplicated code is used. Duplicated code could be caused by duplicated functionality and this will result in duplicated usage of locators. The disadvantage of duplicated code is that the project is less maintainable. If some locator will change, you have to walk through the whole test code to adjust locators where necessary. By using the page object model we can make non-brittle test code and reduce or eliminate duplicate test code. Beside of that it improves the readability and allows us to create interactive documentation. Last but not least, we can create tests with less keystroke. An implementation of the page object model can be achieved by separating the abstraction of the test object and the test scripts.

== Mobile Structure

It is build on the top of the Appium library.
Appium is an open-source tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms. Native apps are those written using the iOS, Android, or Windows SDKs. Mobile web apps are web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in 'Browser' app on Android). Hybrid apps have a wrapper around a "webview" - a native control that enables interaction with web content. 

== How to run tests

One test case fits all browsers.

=== Pre-requisites
==== Setup appium server

It can be downloaded https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases[here]

==== Connect to local Device by Appium Server

 1.
Install Android SDK    https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#command-tools    ->
	2.
Download Platform and Build-Tools  (Android versions - >    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history   )
* sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-19"
* sdkmanager "build-tools;19.0.0"
* copy from /build-tools  file "aapt.exe"  to /platform-tools
	3.
Set Environment:
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT = D:\sdk-tools-windows-4333796
PATH =  %PATH%; %ANDROID_SDK_ROOT%
	4.
Start Appium Server
	5.
Start Session in Appium Server, capabilities
{
  "platformName": "Android",
            "deviceName": "Android Emulator",
            "app": "D:\\Repo\\mrchecker-source\\mrchecker-framework-modules\\mrchecker-mobile-module\\src\\test\\resources\\Simple App_v2.0.1_apkpure.com.apk",
            "automationName": "UiAutomator1"
            }

=== Run on different mobile devices

To execute each test with choosen connected mobile devices, it is required to use specific arguments in Run configuration.

Default supported arguments in MrChecker:

* `deviceUrl` - http url to Appium Server, default value "http://127.0.0.1:4723"

* `automationName` - which automation engine to use , default value "Appium"

* `platformName` - which mobile OS platform to use , default value "Appium"

* `platformVersion` - mobile OS version , default value ""

* `deviceName` - the kind of mobile device or emulator to use , default value "Android Emulator"

* `app` - the absolute local path or remote http URL to a .ipa file (IOS), .app folder (IOS Simulator), .apk file (Android) or .apks file (Android App Bundle), or a .zip file, default value "."

* `browserName` - name of mobile web browser to automate. Should be an empty string if automating an app instead, default value ""

* `newCommandTimeout` - how long (in seconds) Appium will wait for a new command from the client before assuming the client quit and ending the session, default value "4000"

* `deviceOptions` - any other capabilites not covered in essential ones, default value none

Example usage:

----
mvn clean test -Dtest=MyTest -DdeviceUrl="http://192.168.0.1:1234" -DplatformName="iOS" -DdeviceName="iPhone Simulator" -Dapp=".\\Simple_App.ipa"
----

----
mvn clean test -Dtest=MyTest -Dapp=".\\Simple_App.apk -DdeviceOptions="orientation=LANDSCAPE;appActivity=MainActivity;chromeOptions=['--disable-popup-blocking']"

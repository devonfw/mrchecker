The css selector is used to select elements from the HTML page.

Selection by element, class or id are the most common selectors.

----
<p class='myText' id='123'>
----

This text element (p) can be found by using any one of the following selectors:

----
The HTML element: "p". Note: in practical use this will be too generic, if a preceding text section is added, the selected element will change.
The class attribute preceded by ".": ".myText"
The id attribute preceded by "#": "#123"
----

== Using other attributes

When a class or id attribute is not sufficient to identify the other attributes can be used as well, by using "[attribute=value]": For example:

----
<a href='https://ns.nl/example.html'>
----

Can be selected by using the entire value: "a[href='https://ns.nl/example.html'\]". For selecting links starting with, containing, ending with see the list below.

== Using sub-elements
The css selectors can be stacked, by appending them:

----
<div id='1'><a href='ns.nl'></div>
<div id='2'><a href='nsinternational.nl'></div>
----

In the example above, the link element to nsinternational can be obtained by: "#2 a".

== When possible avoid

* Using paths of commonly used HTML elements within the containers (HTML: div). This will cause failures when a container is added, a common occurrence during development. E.g.: "div div p". Use class or id instead, if those are not available, request them to be added in the production code.
* Magic order numbers. It is possible to get the second text element in its contained by using selector "p:nth-child(2)". If the items are representing different items, ask the developer to add specific attributes, it is possible to request all items and iterated later, with a selector similar to ".myList li". .

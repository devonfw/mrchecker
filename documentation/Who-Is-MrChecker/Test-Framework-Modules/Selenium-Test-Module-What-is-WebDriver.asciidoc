= What is WebDriver

On the one hand, it is a very convenient API for the programmer that allows to interact with the browser, on the other hand it is a driver concept that enables this direct communication.

==== How does it work?

A tester, through his/her test script, can command WebDriver to perform certain actions on the WAUT on a certain browser. The way the user can command WebDriver to perform something is by using the client libraries or language bindings provided by WebDriver.

By using the language-binding client libraries, tester can invoke the browser-specific implementations of WebDriver, such as Firefox Driver, IE Driver, Opera Driver, and so on, to interact with the WAUT on the respective browser. These browser-specific implementations of WebDriver will work with the browser natively and execute commands from outside the browser to simulate exactly how the application user does.

After execution, WebDriver will send out the test result back to the test script for developer's analysis.

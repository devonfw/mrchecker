===== My browser opens up by default in German

*Problem:*

I would like my browser to use the English language, but the default language for the browser is German. How can I change the settings?

*Solution:*

There is a Properties file installed together with MrCheker installation. It is possible to set the language in _Properties > Selenium configuration_, in which a browser could be opened for testing purposes.

= Plug in service virtualization

== Classic application structure

This is quite common application structure, where we have either in Application Under Test (AUT):

* UI / GUI
* WebAPI
* 3rd party service

== Classic application structure with virtualization

This classic application is quite fragile for development and/or test process. Special while, component (WebAPI) connected to the application under test is:

* Not yet completed
* Still evolving
* Controlled by a third-party or partner
* Available for testing only in limited capacity or at inconvenient times
* Difficult to provision or configure in a test environment
* Needed for simultaneous access by different teams with varied test data setup and other requirements
* Restricted or costly to use for load and performance testing

Full list of such "classic application structure" limitation you can find here https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/What-is-service-virtualization[What-is-service-virtualization].

*To address such list of impediments, service virtualization is the key solution.*

For simplicity, AUT connects to other component by TCP/IP protocol. Therefore AUT has IP address and port number where given components operates. _To plug in virtualization server, author of AUT ought to switch IP and port instead from real endpoint component (WebAPI) to "proxy server"_ Finally "proxy server" maps requests comes from AUT with either virtual assets or real endpoint component (WebAPI) How maps work in such "proxy server" have a look here https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/How-to-make-virtual-asset[How-to-make-virtual-asset]

Therefore AUT is build either with:

* switchable property file taken while startup

or

* "on fly" operation to change IP and ports of connected components.
